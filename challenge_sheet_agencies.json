      "about": "Sustaining quality of life on Earth and in space requires transformative advances in science and technology, along with new models, policies and behaviors that will guide human development. The search for innovative technology solutions to ensure healthy astronauts orbiting the planet mirrors healthcare challenges faced by providers in developing worlds. The same requirements for simple, rugged, ultra portable, low power devices to provide remote diagnostic capability serves dual needs for humans living within the extreme environments on and off the planet. Targeting preventative health measures within the first twenty years of life offers a unique opportunity to change the human condition for this and future generations. The first twenty years of human development are critical to ensuring a more healthy, equitable and productive human population on the planet. In both developed and developing countries adverse conditions during the first twenty years continue to threaten the next generation with unacceptable rates of acute and chronic disease due to infections, poor nutrition and inadequate daily physical activity. LAUNCH seeks innovations that are preventive with a focus on nutrition, exercise, and health care. Specifically, LAUNCH is seeking innovations in providing and improving:\n\nOptimal nutrition (access, choice, and quality of nutritious food and required nutrients)\nRegular participation in physical activity and healthy lifestyle choices\nParticipation in primary preventive health care including supporting infrastructure, such as diagnostic and monitoring technology",

The Corporation challenges organizations to effectively engage individuals in service to their communities during the National Day of Service and Remembrance. Service activities should honor those who died and those who have served because of the tragedies of 9/11, and include a time of reflection and remembrance. Projects should be implemented on or near September 11, 2011 and clearly be linked to the observance of the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance.\n\nEligible organizations are encouraged to submit a Concept Paper (described below) that details their plans for the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance including how they will challenge their community to join them in service on 9/11/2011. Based upon the number of volunteers engaged by applicants during their 2011 events, selected organizations will receive awards to be used to promote and implement greater levels of engagement in future September 11 National Days of Service and Remembrance (2012 \u2013 2014). The Corporation will award a total of approximately $500,000 through approximately 10-15 awards ranging from $10,000 to $100,000 to organizations that achieve the highest level of volunteer engagement within an established competitive pool (to be determined by the Corporation based upon approved submissions).

      "about": "The Apps for Healthy Kids competition is a part of First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s Let\u2019s Move! campaign to end childhood obesity within a generation. Apps for Healthy Kids challenges software developers, game designers, students, and other innovators to develop fun and engaging software tools and games that drive children, especially \u201ctweens\u201d (ages 9-12) \u2013 directly or through their parents \u2013 to eat better and be more physically active. \n\nChildhood obesity or excess weight threatens the healthy future of one third of American children. We spend approximately $150 billion every year to treat obesity-related conditions, and that number is growing. Obesity rates tripled in the past 30 years, a trend that means, for the first time in our history, American children may face a shorter expected lifespan than their parents. We need to get moving! \n\nTools and games should be built using the USDA nutrition dataset recently made available to the public through the Open Government Initiative. The dataset provides information on total calories, calories from \u201cextras\u201d (solid fats and added sugars), and MyPyramid food groups for over 1,000 commonly eaten foods. We are seeking innovative and creative tools and games that use the USDA dataset to deliver nutrition and health concepts in a fun and engaging way.",

DARPA\u2019s Shredder Challenge calls upon computer scientists, puzzle enthusiasts and anyone else who likes solving complex problems to compete for up to $50,000 by piecing together a series of shredded documents. The goal is to identify and assess potential capabilities that could be used by our warfighters operating in war zones, but might also create vulnerabilities to sensitive information that is protected through our own shredding practices throughout the U.S. national security community.\n\nPresently, a variety of techniques exist for reconstructing shredded documents including manual assembly, fully automated (computerized) algorithms and hybrid operator-assisted approaches. DARPA hopes to gain new insight into which of these or other innovative techniques are quicker and more efficient, and, whether the wide availability of high resolution photography, communication and crowd-sourcing strategies offer unexpected advances. The Shredder Challenge is composed of five separate problems in which the number of documents, subject matter and the method of shredding is varied to present challenges of increasing difficulty. To complete each problem, participants are called upon to provide answers to puzzles embedded in the content of reconstructed documents. The overall prize awarded depends on the number and difficulty of problems solved.",

The project developed an integrated kit that provides:\n\n- Reliable power from primarily renewable sources to power system components\n\n-Potable water from local sources\n\n-Local and global communications to transmit & receive voice, data and images\n\n-Local situational awareness and information sharing\n\nThe kit satisfies all operational requirements as defined by DoD, and delivers more capability than is required by other user organizations. However, the JCTD kit is bigger, heavier and more costly than some user organizations can accommodate.\n\nInterested individuals and organizations are invited to design a kit for use in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HA/DR) situations.  The kit will be suitable for initial HA/DR response activities by US government departments and agencies, as well as by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) and foreign governments.

The NDU Press scavenger hunt will be a first for the Department of Defense (DOD) and is part of an ongoing DOD-wide effort to shift to a more participatory Web. The scavenger hunt will occur in two phases.\n\nThe first phase kicks off Tuesday, December 14, at 12 p.m. from the NDU Press Facebook page. This part of the contest is modeled after the Social Media Scavenger Hunt that the National Archives hosted back in April. On each site, there will be a KEYWORD and a clue leading the user to the next site in the hunt. The first 10 people to send all the keywords in the right order to a provided e-mail address will win a prize. This part of the contest will conclude at 12 p.m. on Thursday, December 16.\n\nThe second part of the contest will take place over 10 days starting Tuesday, December 14. During this part of the Scavenger Hunt, virtual \u201ceaster eggs\u201d will be hidden throughout the NDU Press Web site. To add to the challenge, some easter eggs will only be viewable from specific browsers. Other easter eggs will highlight experimental CSS techniques pioneered by developers such as Andy Clarke and Eric Meyer. Those participants that find an easter egg will win a prize.  This portion of the contest will end Wednesday, December 22.\n\nContest prizes include a signed copy of Partnership for the Americas by Admiral James G.

This challenge asks students to create short videos that will inform students and families of a new resource that makes it easier to calculate how much it might cost to go to a particular college. On October 29, 2011, all colleges and universities were required by law to provide a \u201cnet price calculator\u201d on their websites. This is one of several Department initiatives to make the price of college more transparent and help students and families make informed decisions about investing in postsecondary education. \u201cNet price\u201d is a new and important piece of information about college costs; it helps students and families estimate what it would likely cost to attend a college after accounting for grants and scholarships that don\u2019t need to be repaid.

According to the Electric Power Research Institute, \u201cthe primary obstacle to [hydrogen vehicle] implementation is the perceived infrastructure investment cost associated with building and operating hydrogen fueling stations during the early market penetration years of hydrogen vehicles.\u201d In other words, which should come first\u2014the hydrogen vehicles or the stations to fuel them?\n\nSome are offering an innovative answer: residential fueling. In residential fueling, the hydrogen vehicle owner fuels the vehicle each evening using equipment installed at his or her residence.  Developing residential hydrogen fuelers would mitigate the considerable investment needed for a commercial facility while providing early adopters in areas with no stand-alone station with a convenient option for their fueling needs.\n\nThis type of distributed fueling network is in the beginning stages but shows great promise. Several companies are exploring residential applications of both reformer- and electrolyzer-based hydrogen fueling equipment. For this Contest, we are inviting students to get involved in this exciting new frontier of hydrogen technology development.",

      "about": "Win $1,000 and have your video seen by thousands of people while helping to improve swimmer health! Contrary to popular belief, chlorine does not kill all germs instantly. Each summer, thousands of Americans get sick with recreational water illness (RWIs) after they go swimming. RWIs are illnesses caused by germs found in places where we swim. There are simple steps people can take to help prevent the spread of germs that cause RWIs, but we need your help to spread the word.\n\nTo help us educate swimmers, CDC's Healthy Swimming Program is asking the public to make a short, creative video that promotes the simple steps everyone can take to ensure a healthy and RWI-free swimming experience.\n\nThe video will also help direct people to CDC's Healthy Swimming Website where they can find additional details and resources on healthy swimming behaviors.\n\nYour video could be a rap, sketch, dance, slide show, or anything you want it to be, as long as it includes our four key healthy swimming messages and appeals to a broad audience. The top videos will be posted on CDC's YouTube Channel for public vote. The first-place winner will receive $1,000, courtesy of the CDC Foundation. The winning video will also be featured on CDC's Healthy Swimming Website and CDC's YouTube Channel for thousands to see.",

Its aims include a 20% reduction in readmissions over a three year period and a 40% reduction in preventable hospital acquired conditions.\n\n \n\nNearly one in five patients discharged from a hospital will be readmitted within 30 days. A large proportion of readmissions can be prevented by improving communications and coordinating care before and after discharge. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provides a discharge checklist to help patients and their caregivers prepare to leave a hospital, nursing home, or other care setting. Research has shown that empowering patients and caregivers with information and tools to manage the next steps in their care more confidently is a very effective way to reduce errors, decrease complications, and prevent a return visit to the hospital.",

Winners will be announced September 15th, 2010. The first-prize winner will receive a paid trip for two to attend the Voice Awards in Los Angeles on October 13; and his/her video will be showcased at the event. Two runner-up winners for video and essay submissions will each receive a new Flip MinoHD\u2122 camera, a great tool for them, to keep sharing stories of friendship and recovery.\n\nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) launched the Mental Health Campaign for Mental Health Recovery to encourage, educate, and inspire people between 18 and 25 to support their friends who are experiencing mental health problems. The prevalence of serious mental health conditions in this age group is almost double that of the general population, yet young people have the lowest rate of help-seeking behaviors. This group has a high potential to minimize future disability if social acceptance is broadened and they receive the right support and services early on.\n\nThe opportunity for recovery is more likely in a society of acceptance, and this initiative is meant to inspire young people to serve as the mental health vanguard, motivating a societal change toward acceptance and decreasing the negative attitudes that surround mental illness. Mental health recovery is a journey of healing and transformation, enabling a person with a mental health problem to live a meaningful life in a community of his or her choice while striving to achieve his or her full potential.",

The dashboard should capture data from two or more of these new Basic Stand Alone (BSA) Medicare Claims Public Use Files in a way that addresses the needs and interests of the chosen target end-user group.\n\nBecause no beneficiaries are represented in more than one of the eight BSA PUFs, there is no possibility of linking records across two or more of the files. One of the objectives of the challenge is to design and demonstrate a creative mechanism for combining the information in two or more files in a meaningful manner. You can draw upon statistical matching techniques; create synthetic or derived variables based on data in the PUF and related documentation; or use existing variables that are common across the PUFs to create the associations and relationships.\n\nBy developing innovative data tools and fostering creative analytic approaches for the BSA Medicare Claims PUFs, teams will be contributing to the process of informed health care decision-making. Armed with the information from this process, health care providers and patients can select treatments that are most likely to lead to improved health among the American population.

      "about": "SMART (Substitutable Medical Apps, Reusable Technologies) is one of four Strategic Health IT Advanced Research Projects (SHARP) funded by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.  SMART was conceived to address the real-world need for responsiveness and innovation in health information technology by empowering existing electronic medical records (EMRs) and personally controlled health records (PCHRs) to accept substitutable apps.\n\nCurrently, innovation in health informatics is limited by disparate vendor APIs and ambiguous data standards. Deploying an application against multiple vendor systems requires massive customization efforts that don't scale. SMART provides a common API to access patient records, fueling apps with rich, unambiguous data. This will open up the market of health IT to a new cadre of developers who can write a SMART app once and deploy it inside multiple EMRs and PCHRs.\n\nOur objective is to lower the barriers to creating apps for health, so that you, the developer, can focus on your great ideas!\n\nYour Challenge  Build a SMART App that provides value to patients, providers, or researchers using patient-level data delivered through the SMART API. Your app will be an HTML5 Web app that runs in the SMART Reference EMR, where it can access patient demographics, medications, laboratory tests, and diagnoses using Web standards. You could, for example, build a medication manager, a health risk detector, a laboratory visualization tool, or an app that integrates external data sources (e.g., PubMed, CDC statistics, environmental data, financial data) with patient records in realtime.

Can a web app help school children in Detroit, MI? \n\nThe Knight Foundation and the FCC challenge you to develop a software application (app) that delivers personalized, actionable information to people that are least likely to be online. Using hyper-local government and other public data you should develop an app that enables Americans to benefit from broadband communications -- regardless of geography, race, economic status, disability, residence on Tribal land, or degree of digital or English literacy -- by providing easy access to relevant content.\n\nThe Apps for Communities Challenge is an initiative of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation (\u201cKnight Foundation\u201d) and the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d). The Challenge will offer up to $100,000 in prizes to winning application developers and is intended to bring together providers of public data, developers, and traditionally underserved populations through a national contest. The goals of the Challenge are to:\n\nmake local public information more personalized, usable, and accessible for all Americans;\npromote broadband adoption, particularly among Americans who are less likely to be regular Internet users (including low-income, rural, seniors, people with disabilities and the low digital/English literacy communities); and\ncreate better links between Americans and services provided by local, state, Tribal, and federal governments.\nFor example, you can create an app that gives consumers and small businesses valuable information about their communities in an easy to understand, mostly graphic way on their cell phones; an app that delivers contract and seasonal job post alerts in English and Spanish via text message; an app that connects people to health care in their communities via public transportation; or an app that makes it easy for people with limited digital or English proficiency to go through intro screens without extensive instructions or pressing many tiny keys.  \n\nThe FCC seeks to promote broadband deployment and adoption for all Americans.  New applications can pull new users online, as well as increase the value of a broadband connection for existing users. \n\nConsistent with the Knight Foundation\u2019s mission to foster informed and engaged communities and FCC\u2019s goal to encourage broadband adoption and deployment, the FCC and Knight Foundation are co-sponsoring this Challenge.  With this contest, we want to reward experiments\u2014good ideas\u2014small ideas with big impact that can be replicated throughout the country.",

These apps enable end-users to monitor their Internet service.  The resulting data can help researchers and policy makers gain a better understanding of the evolution of the open Internet.\n\nThe Open Internet Challenge seeks to encourage the development of new, more effective applications that provide users with information about the extent to which their fixed or mobile broadband Internet services are consistent with open Internet principles.  These software tools could, for example, detect whether a broadband provider is interfering with DNS responses, application packet headers, or content.\n\nThese applications should also collect anonoymized data that can be used for network research and analysis of patterns and trends in Internet openness.\n\nOne popular platform for Internet software tools is Measurement Lab (M-Lab), \u201can open, distributed server platform for researchers to deploy Internet measurement tools.\u201d  Those interested in running their software tools on the M-Lab platform should contact the M-Lab steering committee, which coordinates research on the M-Lab platform.

The 2011 Zero Robotics Challenge is a continuation and expansion of a science, technology, engineering and math education program that uses the Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites, or SPHERES, facility aboard the International Space Station.\n\nThe challenge is a new opportunity for teams of high school students to write their own algorithm to fly three small SPHERES satellites around the cabin of the International Space Station. \n\nSPHERES are bowling ball-sized spherical satellites used inside the space station to test maneuvers for spacecraft performing autonomous rendezvous and docking. The three satellites that make up SPHERES fly in formation inside the station's cabin. Each is self-contained with power, propulsion, computing and navigation equipment. The test results are used to support satellite servicing, vehicle assembly and spacecraft that fly in formation.\n\nEntries will be evaluated using simulations, and a final ground testing competition will be held on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Mass. The top 27 teams will have their code sent to the station where an astronaut will program the experiment and run their tests in microgravity.\ufeff",

Craters also inform the selection of landing sites, as well as provide valuable data for path planning and rover navigation.  In addition, craters help scientists align a variety of disparate data sets (radar, laser altimetry, etc.) to each other.\n\nThe data for this challenge consists of orbital images captured by the Apollo 15-17 and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter missions. Craters were manually identified by NASA planetary scientists and by volunteers from around the world as part of the \u201cMoon Zoo\u201d project (http://moonzoo.org). The manually labeled craters provide both training data and a way to measure the performance of the challenge submissions.\n\n\u201cMoon Zoo\u201d is a Zooniverse project, which has over 430,000 registered users helping on a wide variety of Citizen Science projects. The data provided by Moon Zoo for this challenge represents a small sample of a much larger crater catalog currently being compiled. The first full crater catalog from Moon Zoo should be available in late 2011.\n\nOverall, this challenge will help NASA to better, and more effectively, process the ever increasing amounts of orbital imagery of the Moon, Mars and other planetary bodies. This will enable us to better explore and understand our Solar System and beyond.",

Weak gravitational lensing, a consequence of Einstein\u2019s General Theory of Relativity whereby the  apparent shapes of background galaxies are distorted by the gravitational  effects of foreground dark matter, has emerged as one of the best tools for probing dark matter and dark energy. The subtle shape changes caused \nby weak lensing are difficult to disentangle from the signature imprinted \non the galaxies by the necessarily imperfect telescopes used to observe \nthe galaxies. We seek help from talented computer scientists and \nastronomers in deriving fast and accurate algorithms for deconvolving the \nshapes of galaxies from such instrumental effects. Armed with such \nalgorithms, astronomers will, in the coming decade, deploy large \ntelescopes on the ground and in space in order to measure the shapes of \nbillions of distant galaxies and accurately determine the content, nature, and ultimate fate of the Universe.\ufeff",

The panel will select eight teams to design and construct their project for competition. The eight projects will be sent to the near space environment of the stratosphere, or nearly 100,000 feet above the earth, by several NASA weather balloon launches in Northeastern, Ohio.\n\nA wide variety of topics may be pursued in this competition, including science and weather observations, remote sensing and image processing. The top four teams will visit NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) in Cleveland, Ohio, to participate in \u201cFlight Days,\u201d a three-day launch event to release, conduct and recover their experiments and participate in informative tours and presentations. Travel, room and board expenses for up to four students and one adult advisor from each team will be provided for the four-night stay.\n\nNew for 2011, four additional teams will be selected to receive funding to build their Flight Experiment but rather than attending Flight Days, they will participate remotely from their hometowns while NASA scientists and engineers launch and recover their payloads.\n\nThe goal of this program is to stimulate students' interest in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), and provide them with an opportunity to participate in a flight mission.

This requires continual resupply of approximately 0.5 kg/crew/day to replace disposed items. As missions go beyond low earth orbit, there will be no opportunity to resupply additional clothing. In addition, the duration of time spent in space increases as a mission goes beyond low-earth orbit. Therefore, the mass of clothing required to support a crew and the volume to store that clothing become substantial when clothing is discarded and not recycled. This Challenge is seeking a new approach to laundry. For this Challenge, laundry refers to washing, with liquid phase cleaning agent (not necessarily water), to remove soil and odor from clothing, as well as drying to remove any residual fluid from the clothing. Although laundry systems have been previously studied by NASA, the proposed designs have been overly complex and inadequately addressed operation in microgravity. The process of performing laundry typically involves the following steps:\n\nLaundry is loaded into the washing machine.\nA cleaning agent and a liquid (typically water) are added to the machine typically (though not necessarily) automatically.\nAgitation of the clothing, water and cleaning agent occur.\nThe cleaning agent and water is removed from the clothing.\nAdditional liquid (typically water) is added and clothing is rinsed of cleaning agents.\nGross water removal is performed to remove as much water is possible.\nClothing is transferred to another machine for drying (if the dryer is a separate machine).\nClothing drying is performed.",

Astronauts will be living and conducting remote operations in a confined and isolated environment (spacecraft) as well as confined quarters (habitat) for longer periods of time, outside of Low Earth Orbit. As the length of the mission increases, the astronauts may experience cumulative or chronic stress over an extended duration of time. This may have a negative impact on their mental health or behavioral health, or on the functioning and performance of the spaceflight team, and their interactions with ground support or others. It is anticipated that the need for behavioral health countermeasures will also increase. \n\nOne consideration is that of a system that augments the exercise experience and captures psychological and physiological measures while the individual crew member is participating in prescribed exercise regimens. This virtual, interactive system will serve as a countermeasure by enhancing the exercise experience. \n\nThis is a new approach to enhancing the behavioral health and performance of crews during long duration exploration mission. We believe current technology is available to develop an interactive physical and psychological system to support an individualized system. The goal of this Challenge is to come up with an interactive flexible system that can enhance the exercise experience for long space flights. The Solvers should concentrate on what equipment and processes would be required to set up such a system given the limited space and weight requirements on a spacecraft.",

Modeling and simulation has long played a key role at NASA in the development of aircraft, spacecraft, planetary missions, and air traffic control designs.  Thus NASA has a strong interest in assuring that the next generation of employees is literate in this key technology area.  Modeling and simulation has just begun to appear in state K-12 content standards (e.g. Virginia science grades 6 \u2013 12).  In an effort to connect practicing scientists and engineers with K-12 classroom needs and jumpstart the availability of K-12 resource material in modeling and simulation, NASA has partnered with the CK-12 Foundation (CK12.org) to develop a FlexBook on modeling and simulation for high school use.  A FlexBook, as developed by the CK-12 Foundation, is a flexible textbook \u2013 a freely available, open content, creative commons licensed, web-based book that can be customized to the readers needs by employing the CK-12 technology platform.  Please see for example the \u201c21st Century Physics Flexbook\u201d at http://www.ck12.org/flexbook/flexbook/735.\n\n \n\nThrough this challenge, NASA seeks authors of chapters for a Modeling and Simulation FlexBook for use by high school teachers and students.  Authors can be individuals or teams of people.

Our experience is overly complicated user interfaces are either misused or eventually ignored due to time constraints. Compliance in the past with written systems has been low, so a standard barcode scanner is thought unlikely to deliver the required compliance. We need something that is really minimal hands on by the user. Ultimately, the system will marry hardware/software with a database allowing physicians to know what medical consumables have been used, who used them, and when the medications in the kit expire so that the kit can be replenished in a timely fashion. The size of the kit can vary, but you can assume it has a volume of 0.008 m3 or less. The inventory tracking system should be flexible for the number of users, but 6 would be the maximum number of users on one time.",

In a world where science literacy is dismayingly rare, illustrations provide the most immediate and influential connection between scientists and other citizens, and the best hope for nurturing popular interest. Indeed, they are now a necessity for public understanding of research developments.\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) and the journal Science created the International Science & Engineering Visualization Challenge to celebrate that grand tradition--and to encourage its continued growth. The spirit of the competition is to communicate science, engineering and technology for education and journalistic purposes.\n\nJudges appointed by NSF and Science will select winners in each of five categories: Photography, Illustrations, Informational Posters and Graphics, Interactive Games and Videos. The winning entries will appear in a special section in Science and Science Online, and on the NSF website, and one of the winning entries will be pictured on the front cover.
