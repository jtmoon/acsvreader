Childhood obesity or excess weight threatens the healthy future of one third of American children. We spend approximately $150 billion every year to treat obesity-related conditions, and that number is growing. Obesity rates tripled in the past 30 years, a trend that means, for the first time in our history, American children may face a shorter expected lifespan than their parents. We need to get moving! 

Tools and games should be built using the USDA nutrition dataset recently made available to the public through the Open Government Initiative. The dataset provides information on total calories, calories from “extras” (solid fats and added sugars), and MyPyramid food groups for over 1,000 commonly eaten foods.

This is one of several Department initiatives to make the price of college more transparent and help students and families make informed decisions about investing in postsecondary education. “Net price” is a new and important piece of information about college costs; it helps students and families estimate what it would likely cost to attend a college after accounting for grants and scholarships that don’t need to be repaid. Unfortunately, too few people know what “net price” means, and where to find a college’s net price calculator on its website, or how to use net price – along with other information – when comparison shopping for higher education. Help us get the word out!",Panel of Five Independent Judges,"Content

In the transportation sector, major auto manufacturers and energy companies have invested billions of dollars in the development of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles and commercial hydrogen fueling stations.

The transition to using hydrogen as a fuel is underway, but there are still many key questions to be answered, including the well-known challenge of fueling infrastructure development. According to the Electric Power Research Institute, “the primary obstacle to [hydrogen vehicle] implementation is the perceived infrastructure investment cost associated with building and operating hydrogen fueling stations during the early market penetration years of hydrogen vehicles.” In other words, which should come first—the hydrogen vehicles or the stations to fuel them?

Some are offering an innovative answer: residential fueling. In residential fueling, the hydrogen vehicle owner fuels the vehicle each evening using equipment installed at his or her residence.  Developing residential hydrogen fuelers would mitigate the considerable investment needed for a commercial facility while providing early adopters in areas with no stand-alone station with a convenient option for their fueling needs.

This type of distributed fueling network is in the beginning stages but shows great promise.

There are two parts of the program.

The two parts of the program allow all students to gain knowledge of energy and awareness of energy use and then learn about energy saving methods.

America’s Home Energy Education Challenge is designed to:

Educate students across the United States in grades 3-8 about energy and the benefits of energy efficiency
Teach students to recognize that lowering their home energy use saves money
Engage students and their families in a save energy, save money initiative. 
Sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy and administered by the National Science Teachers Association, America’s Home Energy Education Challenge aims to enhance and extend existing energy-focused programs, provide specific home energy-saving tips, and make materials that support the learning of science and energy available to schools.  Participating schools compete for more than $200,000 in prizes distributed at the regional and national levels of the competition.

Home Energy Award, the first segment of the Challenge, inspires friendly competition among classes and schools.  These competitions (the group of schools or classes within a school that make up the local competition) in 11 regions of the U.S. compete for $102,000 in cash prizes the winning projects will be based on student participation rates, energy savings, and the overall creativity and quality of the participating local competition.

Students who are unable to monitor their individual home energy may participate in an optional activity of the Challenge that involves developing a home energy savings plan and a poster depicting that plan.  The Energy Conservation Plan and Poster Contest is designed to help participants who are unable to collect data and increase awareness of actions that could result in energy savings.  The winners of this optional program will be judged on their poster and their plan and compete for $48,000 in cash prizes.

Energy Fitness Award, the second segment of the Challenge, focuses directly on individual and classroom knowledge about energy.  This online component is a separate educational gaming activity; students can participate at any time and can return to play multiple times.

Its aims include a 20% reduction in readmissions over a three year period and a 40% reduction in preventable hospital acquired conditions.

 

Nearly one in five patients discharged from a hospital will be readmitted within 30 days. A large proportion of readmissions can be prevented by improving communications and coordinating care before and after discharge. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) provides a discharge checklist to help patients and their caregivers prepare to leave a hospital, nursing home, or other care setting. Research has shown that empowering patients and caregivers with information and tools to manage the next steps in their care more confidently is a very effective way to reduce errors, decrease complications, and prevent a return visit to the hospital.","Don Detmer

The prevalence of serious mental health conditions in this age group is almost double that of the general population, yet young people have the lowest rate of help-seeking behaviors. This group has a high potential to minimize future disability if social acceptance is broadened and they receive the right support and services early on.

The opportunity for recovery is more likely in a society of acceptance, and this initiative is meant to inspire young people to serve as the mental health vanguard, motivating a societal change toward acceptance and decreasing the negative attitudes that surround mental illness.

The dashboard should capture data from two or more of these new Basic Stand Alone (BSA) Medicare Claims Public Use Files in a way that addresses the needs and interests of the chosen target end-user group.

Because no beneficiaries are represented in more than one of the eight BSA PUFs, there is no possibility of linking records across two or more of the files. One of the objectives of the challenge is to design and demonstrate a creative mechanism for combining the information in two or more files in a meaningful manner. You can draw upon statistical matching techniques; create synthetic or derived variables based on data in the PUF and related documentation; or use existing variables that are common across the PUFs to create the associations and relationships.

By developing innovative data tools and fostering creative analytic approaches for the BSA Medicare Claims PUFs, teams will be contributing to the process of informed health care decision-making. Armed with the information from this process, health care providers and patients can select treatments that are most likely to lead to improved health among the American population. Focusing on treatments that are more effective will result in program savings over time.","Todd Park

SMART was conceived to address the real-world need for responsiveness and innovation in health information technology by empowering existing electronic medical records (EMRs) and personally controlled health records (PCHRs) to accept substitutable apps.

Currently, innovation in health informatics is limited by disparate vendor APIs and ambiguous data standards. Deploying an application against multiple vendor systems requires massive customization efforts that don't scale. SMART provides a common API to access patient records, fueling apps with rich, unambiguous data. This will open up the market of health IT to a new cadre of developers who can write a SMART app once and deploy it inside multiple EMRs and PCHRs.

Our objective is to lower the barriers to creating apps for health, so that you, the developer, can focus on your great ideas!

Your Challenge  Build a SMART App that provides value to patients, providers, or researchers using patient-level data delivered through the SMART API. Your app will be an HTML5 Web app that runs in the SMART Reference EMR, where it can access patient demographics, medications, laboratory tests, and diagnoses using Web standards. You could, for example, build a medication manager, a health risk detector, a laboratory visualization tool, or an app that integrates external data sources (e.g., PubMed, CDC statistics, environmental data, financial data) with patient records in realtime.

","﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Nearly 50 years after President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act, on average women are still paid less than their male counterparts for doing comparable jobs – that’s called the pay gap. It means that each time the average woman starts a new job, she’s likely to start from a lower base salary, but it also means that over time the pay gap between her and her male colleagues is likely to become wider and wider.

For the average working woman, the pay gap means $150 less in her weekly paycheck, $8,000 less at the end of the year, and $380,000 less over her lifetime. For women of color and women with disabilities, the disparity is even bigger.

Your challenge is to use publicly available labor data and other online resources to educate users about the pay gap and to build tools to promote equal pay.  

Each submission should achieve at least one of the following goals:

Provide greater access to pay data by gender, race, and ethnicity: 
These features should provide data that would be helpful to women throughout their careers as they negotiate starting pay, request a promotion or a raise, or consider switching fields to a more lucrative career path.  Participants must ensure that their submission complies with all applicable laws and regulations. 
Provide tools for early career coaching:
These features should use publicly available data to create an interactive online experience to educate young women on the pay gap and enable informed decision- making when selecting a career path.
Help inform negotiations: 
These features should provide feedback, tips, and critiques that guide users through the process of negotiating starting salary, pay rate, job level, or requesting a promotion or raise.  These tools should also educate individuals about their legal rights.
Promote online mentoring: 
These features should expand individuals’ access to broader communities and mentorship opportunities by providing a means to connect with others for career guidance.","Secretary Hilda L. Solis, U.S. Department of Labor

The aim of the Challenge is to find the best models worldwide for public-private partnerships that catalyze finance for SMEs and to give the creators of those models a chance to solicit financing.

SMEs play a major role in economic development and are often the single largest source of job creation, particularly in emerging economies. Lack of access to finance, however, is a major obstacle to these firms’ growth. Only an estimated 20 percent of small firms in low-income countries have access to credit. SMEs are often too small to attract commercial bank or investor interest, but too large to benefit from microfinance products. To date, few scalable solutions to support this ""missing middle"" tier of businesses have been found.","

Proposals should target SMEs with a focus on the small end of the spectrum.

Leverage: Winning entries will propose solutions that maximize the leverage of scarce public resources in catalyzing private finance.

Social and Economic Impact: Proposals must have a track record with measurable results. They must have a clear, measurable financial access impact, demonstrated by results from pilot or other empirical testing. They should credibly estimate the number of underserved SMEs that could be reached over a designated time frame, the volume of private SME finance that could be catalyzed, the amount of finance that would be available to individual targeted SMEs, the new markets and areas to be served by the proposal, and the potential for job creation (where possible).

Veterans report challenges, however, in “translating” military job skills to their civilian counterparts and in obtaining civilian credit for military training.

More challenging is obtaining civilian recognition of military training when formal education is a prerequisite for employment or licensure.

Can a web app help school children in Detroit, MI? 

The Knight Foundation and the FCC challenge you to develop a software application (app) that delivers personalized, actionable information to people that are least likely to be online. Using hyper-local government and other public data you should develop an app that enables Americans to benefit from broadband communications -- regardless of geography, race, economic status, disability, residence on Tribal land, or degree of digital or English literacy -- by providing easy access to relevant content.

The Apps for Communities Challenge is an initiative of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation (“Knight Foundation”) and the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). The Challenge will offer up to $100,000 in prizes to winning application developers and is intended to bring together providers of public data, developers, and traditionally underserved populations through a national contest. The goals of the Challenge are to:

make local public information more personalized, usable, and accessible for all Americans;
promote broadband adoption, particularly among Americans who are less likely to be regular Internet users (including low-income, rural, seniors, people with disabilities and the low digital/English literacy communities); and
create better links between Americans and services provided by local, state, Tribal, and federal governments.
For example, you can create an app that gives consumers and small businesses valuable information about their communities in an easy to understand, mostly graphic way on their cell phones; an app that delivers contract and seasonal job post alerts in English and Spanish via text message; an app that connects people to health care in their communities via public transportation; or an app that makes it easy for people with limited digital or English proficiency to go through intro screens without extensive instructions or pressing many tiny keys.  

The FCC seeks to promote broadband deployment and adoption for all Americans.  New applications can pull new users online, as well as increase the value of a broadband connection for existing users. 

Consistent with the Knight Foundation’s mission to foster informed and engaged communities and FCC’s goal to encourage broadband adoption and deployment, the FCC and Knight Foundation are co-sponsoring this Challenge.  With this contest, we want to reward experiments—good ideas—small ideas with big impact that can be replicated throughout the country.","Marc Andreessen

Today, Internet users have access to some software tools that provide real-time information on network properties such as network performance, traffic shaping, and application discrimination.  These apps enable end-users to monitor their Internet service.  The resulting data can help researchers and policy makers gain a better understanding of the evolution of the open Internet.

The Open Internet Challenge seeks to encourage the development of new, more effective applications that provide users with information about the extent to which their fixed or mobile broadband Internet services are consistent with open Internet principles.  These software tools could, for example, detect whether a broadband provider is interfering with DNS responses, application packet headers, or content.

These applications should also collect anonoymized data that can be used for network research and analysis of patterns and trends in Internet openness.

One popular platform for Internet software tools is Measurement Lab (M-Lab), “an open, distributed server platform for researchers to deploy Internet measurement tools.”  Those interested in running their software tools on the M-Lab platform should contact the M-Lab steering committee, which coordinates research on the M-Lab platform.

Mapping Dark Matter is a image analysis competition whose aim is to encourage the development of new algorithms that can be applied to challenge of measuring the tiny distortions in galaxy images caused by dark matter.

The aim is to measure the shapes of galaxies to reconstruct the gravitational lensing signal in the presence of noise and a known Point Spread Function. The signal is a very small change in the galaxies’ ellipticity, an exactly circular galaxy image would be changed into an ellipse; however real galaxies are not circular.

The challenge is to measure the ellipticity of 100,000 simulated galaxies.",N/A,The evaluation will be calculated by taking the RMS of the true e1 e2 values in comparison to the submitted values.,5 - working on a scientific problem,5 - algorthms for problem resolution,Point Solution,

Weak gravitational lensing, a consequence of Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity whereby the  apparent shapes of background galaxies are distorted by the gravitational  effects of foreground dark matter, has emerged as one of the best tools for probing dark matter and dark energy. The subtle shape changes caused 
by weak lensing are difficult to disentangle from the signature imprinted 
on the galaxies by the necessarily imperfect telescopes used to observe 
the galaxies. We seek help from talented computer scientists and 
astronomers in deriving fast and accurate algorithms for deconvolving the 
shapes of galaxies from such instrumental effects. Armed with such 
algorithms, astronomers will, in the coming decade, deploy large 
telescopes on the ground and in space in order to measure the shapes of 
billions of distant galaxies and accurately determine the content, nature, and ultimate fate of the Universe.﻿",N/A,N/A,5 - working on a scientific problem,5 - algorthms for problem resolution,Point Solution,

On ISS today, all crew clothing, washcloths, and towels,are discarded after they are sufficiently soiled. This requires continual resupply of approximately 0.5 kg/crew/day to replace disposed items. As missions go beyond low earth orbit, there will be no opportunity to resupply additional clothing. In addition, the duration of time spent in space increases as a mission goes beyond low-earth orbit. Therefore, the mass of clothing required to support a crew and the volume to store that clothing become substantial when clothing is discarded and not recycled. This Challenge is seeking a new approach to laundry. For this Challenge, laundry refers to washing, with liquid phase cleaning agent (not necessarily water), to remove soil and odor from clothing, as well as drying to remove any residual fluid from the clothing. Although laundry systems have been previously studied by NASA, the proposed designs have been overly complex and inadequately addressed operation in microgravity. The process of performing laundry typically involves the following steps:

Laundry is loaded into the washing machine.
A cleaning agent and a liquid (typically water) are added to the machine typically (though not necessarily) automatically.
Agitation of the clothing, water and cleaning agent occur.
The cleaning agent and water is removed from the clothing.
Additional liquid (typically water) is added and clothing is rinsed of cleaning agents.
Gross water removal is performed to remove as much water is possible.
Clothing is transferred to another machine for drying (if the dryer is a separate machine).
Clothing drying is performed.",NASA,"NASA will evaluate the Solver’s solution based on the limited cleaning/refreshing of clothing, the soundness of the technical approach to laundry, and how well the Solver’s solution has addressed integration of the laundry system to spacecraft resources (mass, volume, power, crew time), and requirements (noise/vibration, out gassing).",5- solving a scientic problem of interest to Interational Space Station (ISS) and NASA,5 - a new system with laundry capabilities,Point Solution,

Astronauts will be living and conducting remote operations in a confined and isolated environment (spacecraft) as well as confined quarters (habitat) for longer periods of time, outside of Low Earth Orbit. As the length of the mission increases, the astronauts may experience cumulative or chronic stress over an extended duration of time. This may have a negative impact on their mental health or behavioral health, or on the functioning and performance of the spaceflight team, and their interactions with ground support or others. It is anticipated that the need for behavioral health countermeasures will also increase. 

One consideration is that of a system that augments the exercise experience and captures psychological and physiological measures while the individual crew member is participating in prescribed exercise regimens. This virtual, interactive system will serve as a countermeasure by enhancing the exercise experience. 

This is a new approach to enhancing the behavioral health and performance of crews during long duration exploration mission. We believe current technology is available to develop an interactive physical and psychological system to support an individualized system. The goal of this Challenge is to come up with an interactive flexible system that can enhance the exercise experience for long space flights.

The NNL Program, which is administered by the National Park Service, recognizes outstanding examples of biological and geological features and supports landowners' voluntary conservation efforts.

  

There are 586 sites nationwide that have been given National Natural Landmark designation by the Secretary of the Interior.  Landmark sites are not national park units but are natural areas owned by a variety of landowners including Federal, state, county, municipal, tribal and private organizations and individuals.  While many sites are open to visitation, designation does not require public access.  Thus some sites are not open to the public or require landowner permission.

 

For this contest, each entrant may submit up to three photographs, but each photograph must be from a different NNL site.  The contest ends June 30, 2011, so don’t delay. 

 

Thirteen winning photographs will be selected by vote by National Park Service employees nationwide.  ",National Park Service employees,Vote by National Park Service employees nationwide,4,4,Exposition,

From the diagrams of DaVinci to Rosalind Franklin's X-rays, visualization of research has a long and literally illustrious history. To illustrate is to enlighten.

How many people would have heard of fractal geometry or the double helix or solar flares if they had been described solely in words? In a world where science literacy is dismayingly rare, illustrations provide the most immediate and influential connection between scientists and other citizens, and the best hope for nurturing popular interest. Indeed, they are now a necessity for public understanding of research developments.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) and the journal Science created the International Science & Engineering Visualization Challenge to celebrate that grand tradition--and to encourage its continued growth. The spirit of the competition is to communicate science, engineering and technology for education and journalistic purposes.

Judges appointed by NSF and Science will select winners in each of five categories: Photography, Illustrations, Informational Posters and Graphics, Interactive Games and Videos. The winning entries will appear in a special section in Science and Science Online, and on the NSF website, and one of the winning entries will be pictured on the front cover.

Major transformations are underway in the U.S. economy, opening up unprecedented opportunities for entrepreneurs:

Education is shifting from paper to digital.
Energy is shifting from dirty to clean.
Healthcare is shifting from volume to value.
How do we get there faster?

A lot of entrepreneurs have an idea about how the federal government could help knock down some of the barriers they face every day.  But they probably don’t have time to translate this idea into a rigorous policy proposal – after all, they’ve got businesses to run.

Meanwhile, other members of the public, including students, have time to do that research.  But they may not know what barriers are most important.

Enter the Startup America Policy Challenge:  President Obama’s Administration will ask entrepreneurs and the American public how to knock down barriers to innovation in healthcare IT, clean energy, and learning technologies. Entrepreneurs and other members of the public will post their ideas online. The public, including students and other solvers, will be invited to translate the best ideas into ""Policy Business Plans,"" which will be shared with President Obama's Cabinet.",A network of universities (http://policychallenge.asu.edu/) has decided to analyze the issues posed by the Cabinet Secretaries.,"Solver teams will choose an idea and develop detailed ""Policy Business Plans"" for Federal government action.
